# GE1_Assignment

### Proposal:
I plan on creating a top down "bullet hell" style game with procedurally generated maps using tile sets or "rooms" linked to specific musical ques that you must pass by dispatching of all remaining enemies that will be procedurally spawned as each room progresses. I plan on implementing a life system to allow for some mistakes to be made before you're met with the inevitable Game Over screen. Extra lives will have a chance to be aquired in certain rooms up to a max value.

### The Final Product:
As development continued, the game stayed close to it's original design, although I have changed a few small details, such as the room finishing with the song, to avoid any harsh cuts, and removing the concept of regaining lives to increase the difficulty level.

### Proud points:
The feature I'm most proud of would have to be the mix of room tiling and procedural motion to create new experiences with each playthough, that, given enough added songs and tiles, could increase exponentially. 

### To do list:
- [X] Character movement
- [X] Room spawning
- [X] Enemy spawning
- [X] Enemy AI
- [X] Room feature design
- [X] Syncing the Rooms to Music
- [X] Implementing scoring
- [X] Implementing lives
